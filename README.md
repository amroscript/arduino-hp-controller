# arduin-hp-controller for heat pump systems
This repository consists of an Arduino-driven controller is designed to monitor and control heat-pump parameters in real-time, offering an interface for initialization, settings updates, and operations management with feedback through a terminal display.

## Installation 

In order to use this package, you can download the Python/Arduino files and use them in your own script. 
Installation steps are:
1.  Download or clone the repository via git:
